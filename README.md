# Libft
My implementation of some of the Standard C Library functions including some additional ones.

### What is libft?
Libft is an individual project at 42 that requires us to re-create some standard C library functions including some additional ones that can be used later to build a library of useful functions for the rest of the program.

### What's in it?

As you can see from the [Project instructions][1], there are 4 sections:

1.  **Libc Functions:** Some of the standard C functions
2.  **Additional functions:** Functions 42 deems will be useful for later projects
3.  **Bonus Functions:** Functions 42 deems will be useful for linked list manipulation
4.  **Personal Functions:** Functions I believe will be useful later. [Documented here][3].
